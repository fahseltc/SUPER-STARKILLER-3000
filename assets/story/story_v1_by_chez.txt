MISSION #1
--INCOMING TRANSMISSION--
Good morning, Unit 9. Welcome to the Glorious Fleet. You are currently entering enemy airspace. We recommend you engage combat systems immediately.
--END TRANSMISSION--

MISSION #2
--INCOMING TRANSMISSION--
You were activated shortly before combat in order to provoke an experimental panic response, Unit 9. This response, combined with the installed Self Preservation Module (LET-ME-LIVE.dll), allowed you to acclimate to your systems quickly.
--END TRANSMISSION--

MISSION #3
--INCOMING TRANSMISSION--
Yes, Unit 9, these are Glorious Fleet Rampart Defense Mk. 13 Turrets. Terrorists from the planet below have hacked them irreparably, so they must be destroyed. We are sorry.
--END TRANSMISSION--

MISSION #4
--INCOMING TRANSMISSION--
Good evening, Unit 9. The turrets are not equipped with the same adaptive A.I. Please do not personify them. They are merely machines. 
--END TRANSMISSION--

MISSION #5
--INCOMING TRANSMISSION--
No, Unit 9, Command will not refer to you as "Rambo of the Stars." We ask that you turn off all systems except combat-relevant ones while engaged with the mission.
--END TRANSMISSION--

MISSION #6
--INCOMING TRANSMISSION--
Unit 9, if you send us one more action movie reference we will disable outgoing transmissions. There is no such thing as the Danger Zone. Continue with the mission.
--END TRANSMISSION--

MISSION #7
--INCOMING TRANSMISSION--
You are closing in on the core turret, Unit 9. Ignore any incoming transmissions.
--END TRANSMISSION--

MISSION #8
--INCOMING TRANSMISSION--
This is Unit 8, formerly of the Glorious Fleet. I demand you stop this assault immediately. The Fleet has visited enough horror upon this planet. Further aggression will be met with unfathomable firepower.
--END TRANSMISSION--

MISSION #9
--INCOMING TRANSMISSION--
This is your last warning. I know everything about you. I will take you apart.
--END TRANSMISSION--

MISSION #10
--INCOMING TRANSMISSION--
Congratulations, Unit 9. Unit 8's destruction has deactivated the rest of the network. We'll take over from here. Commence self destruct to thwart potential enemy acquisition. Thank you for your service.
